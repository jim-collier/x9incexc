# Dependencies README

This folder contains one or more archives, of dependencies that existed at the time of last build. This folder only exists for projects that:

1. Are relatively simple.
1. Expect to be stable for years, after some numer of active years of maintenance and bugfixes.
	- And which may need to rely on ancient archived dependencies that aren't around anymore.
1. Expect to be in active use for perhaps decades.

Note that "system.7z" is built automatically by 'build.sh'.

The original go binaries used to build this should be in here too.
