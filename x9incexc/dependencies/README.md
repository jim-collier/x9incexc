# Dependencies README

This folder contains one or more archives, of dependencies that existed at the time of last build. This folder only exists for projects that:

1. Are relatively simple.
1. Expect to be stable for years, after some numer of active years of maintenance and bugfixes.
	- And which may need to rely on ancient archived dependencies that aren't around anymore.
1. Expect to be in active use for perhaps decades.
